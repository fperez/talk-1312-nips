# Talk at NIPS 2013 MLOSS workshop

These are the materials for an invited talk I delivered at the
[workshop on Machine Learning and Open Source Software](http://mloss.org/workshop/nips13),
during the [NIPS 2013](http://nips.cc/Conferences/2013) conference in Lake
Tahoe.

The talk was written as an IPython Notebook, you can view it:

- Rendered as notebook-style HTML
  [on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fperez/talk-nips-2013/blob/master/IPython-Interactive-Computing.ipynb)
  
- Rendered as an HTML Reveal.js Slideshow.  Clone the repo and open the HTML
  version of the file with your web browser (Github won't automatically render
  HTML files with JS, so I can't provide a Github link that will work).
